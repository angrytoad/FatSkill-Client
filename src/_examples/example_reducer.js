 * This is just an example reducer in case you are unsure as to how redux reducers look or are created.
 * If you don't remove the example reducer out of the rootReducer file then when you dispatch
 * the action test you will see the console.info to confirm its working.
 *
 * NOTE: NEVER MUTATE THE STATE - Read more here: http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html
